# Deprecated Folder
This folder is created during the elementary stage of exploring Node.js. It contains separated files for the front page, audio upload, and simple JSON requests with the postman. It helps to gain some elementary insights into how different components of the project works. However, since all components are separated, it did not become beneficial when constructing a full Node.js program, thus deprecating after the second sprint.
