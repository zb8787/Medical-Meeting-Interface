This is a diarization demo, input is an audio file sample from a podcast with two speakers.
Output is a graph plotting in sync with the audio file, indicating who is speaking and when.
This demo requires the user to pre-identify both speakers for a small sample of the audio.\
Included in this directory is an .mp3 audio file for the demo, but this must be converted to a .wav file. This is due to the large size of the .wav file and github restrictions.
