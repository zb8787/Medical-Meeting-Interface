# Learning Node.js
This is a learning history log in which a Node.js course by The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition) by Andrew Mead and Rob Percival are studied in detail to enable a better understanding of Node.js.
This folder is created during the elementary stage of exploring Node.js. It contains separated files for the front page, audio upload, and simple JSON requests with the postman. It helps to gain some elementary insights into how different components of the project works. However, since all components are separated, it did not become beneficial when constructing a full Node.js program, thus deprecating after the second sprint.
